                <h1>Population of Roma </h1>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>The Romani (also spelled Romany or Rromani /ˈroʊməni/, /ˈrɒ-/), colloquially known as the Roma, are
                    an Indo-Aryan ethnic group, traditionally nomadic itinerants. They live in Europe and Anatolia, and
                    have diaspora populations located worldwide, with significant concentrations in the Americas.

                    In the English language, the Romani people are widely known by the exonym Gypsies (or Gipsies),[68]
                    which is considered pejorative by many Romani people due to its connotations of illegality and
                    irregularity as well as its historical use as a racial slur.[69][70][71] For versions (some of which
                    are cognates) of the word in many other languages (e.g., French: Tzigane, Spanish: gitano, Italian:
                    zingaro, Portuguese: cigano, Romanian: țigan and German: Zigeuner) this perception is either very
                    small or non-existent.[72][73] At the first World Romani Congress in 1971, its attendees unanimously
                    voted to reject the use of all exonyms for the Romani people, including Gypsy, due to their
                    aforementioned negative and stereotypical connotations.[70]</p>
