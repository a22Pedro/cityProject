    <h1>History of Roma </h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Antiquity</strong>Rome was founded, according to tradition, by Romulus and Remus, both suckled by a she-wolf, called Luperca, on April 21, 753 BC. C.36

                Prior to the founding of the city, and also contemporary to it, Italy was inhabited by different peoples: the Latins, who occupied the plain between the Tiber river and the Alban mountains; the Tiber separated the Umbrians to the south and the Etruscans to the north, to the east and southeast of Latium was the Apennine chain that would be the domain of related nomadic shepherds: the Sabines, Samnites, Marsi, Volsci, Campani in Naples, Auson and Oscos. Still further south, the Lucanians and Brucians.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle Ages</strong>With the end of the Western Roman Empire, a period marked by the barbarian presence in Italy took place in Rome and, above all, by the affirmation of the Church in power (with the pope as head), which replaced the Empire and brought down the bridge that would have united the Antiquity with the new world.53

                Many struggles in the Roman and European spheres did not allow the establishment of a constant political structure in Rome, which therefore went through different forms of government: it was dominated first by the Goths and later by the Byzantines.54 In this period the creation of a Roman duchy was carried out, whose limits corresponded, roughly, with the city and the territory that surrounded it.55</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Age</strong>After the Lutheran reform (1517) and the sacking of Rome by Charles V (1527), the Council of Trent took place, culminating in 1563, which confirmed Rome as the capital of the Papal State, although from that moment on the figure of the Pope diminished his influence on European politics.65

                The period following the Council of Trent was characterized by an urban renewal of the city: nobles and powerful cardinal families abandoned their palaces in the center to build new homes on the hills; but the true architect of the great work of architectural, cultural and economic modernization of the city of Rome was Pope Sixtus V, pontiff for only five years (1585-1590).66 In 1626 the new Basilica of Saint Peter was inaugurated , emblem of papal rule.</li>
